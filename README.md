The files **monitoring.c** and **monitoring.h** are the mandatory files to add to your embedded project. These files must not be modified until you know what you are doing.

In the examples folder, there are several examples of .c and .lua files that shows how to use the tool. The example01 is a very basic example in pseudo code c that shows the minimal setup.

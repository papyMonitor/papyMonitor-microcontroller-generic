# FreeRTOS example

This is a complete example that works with FreeRTOS. The .lua configuration file is provided as well as the various shapes that form a multiaxles robot.

This example doesn't work as it, you need to add your specific target libraries as well as the FreeRTOS library.

Read the myMonitor.c to see how variables are added to the variables[] structure and to see how a callback can be defined and called.
Read the .lua file to see how to deal with commands (end of the file)
